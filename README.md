# COMPSYS 726 Assignment

#### Antony Southworth

## Getting Started

This project has been written in the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/)
programming language. You can follow the link to for installation instructions.
Keeping all of the defaults should be fine; i.e use the "stable" toolchain.


### Building

To build all nodes in the project, use the following command:

```
cargo build --release
```

`cargo` is the Rust package manager and build tool, and should be installed
along with the main language installation from above. If the command doesn't
work, ensure that `~/.cargo/bin` is on your PATH. The Rust installer should do
this for you, but you may need to restart your terminal first.


### Running

TODO: Finish me.
